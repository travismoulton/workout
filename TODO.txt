//4: Need to add modal with confirmation for deleting workouts and routines
//8: Go through and configure the enter button to act as expected on each component -- Maybe
//9: Need a feature to record a workout on a past day
//10: Add a feature to text search for workouts?
  => Would need to grab all exercises on page load from firebase. Then just search against those.
//11: Should show last recorded workout, and workouts last week on the user profile page
//12: Add functionality to have user's picture through firebase
//13: If you are editing a workout, and you use the add from search functionality, it goes back to create-workout
//14: Delete the wgerDict reducer
//15: Add Time and Distance options to workout creation
//16: Custom exercises are breaking CreateWorkout
//17: Add option to delete a custom workout
//18: On userprofile, it's possible to active the dropdowns before the component is ready. Need to add a loaded piece of state
//19: If you delete a workout that is contained in a routine, that routineLink on userProfile doesn't update the workout count unless the page is refreshed
//20 Rendering the modal component on every workout link. Need to float it up to userProfile

LEFT OFF --- Need to create the Modal inside userProfile so it's not being rendered inside every workoutLink





// Create exercise:
Need a form 
  - Takes title - required - check
  - Category - optional - check
  - Equipment - optional - check
  - Description - optional 
  - Primary muscles - Optional - check
  - Secondary muscles - optional

Going to keep them outside of the master exercise list and search functionality. Inside search, add a 4th Category of "my custom exercises"
CreateWorkout will get an additional select menu of my custom exercises
No redux store should be required?
Could add them into text based search
Will not have a favorites functionality
Will need to modify results and exercise detail to handle custom exercises


















// FINISHED BUT SAVE FOR LATER
FOR CHANING WORKOUT STRUCTURE:
//1: WorkoutListItem must change. Need to change the input structure. Start w/ Set 1 and has a weight and reps input. Have a button for adding another set
//2: Redux workout store will need to change. Each exercise object will contain a sets array made up of objects with weight and reps number values
//3: Will most likely want to create a component to represent each set, and host all logic about incrementing and decrementing weight and reps in there.


SUB_STEPS:
//1: In create workout line 267 addExercise is dispatched. I will need to change the object to contain 
  name, id, and a sets array that contains objects with weight and reps values

//2: The props being passed to WorkoutListItem will need to change. Specifically weight, sets, and reps. 
  Will just pass the sets array containing objects with weight and reps data

//3: Need to a button to add additional Sets

//4: I believe the updateExerciseData action will need to be modified.

//5: Left off at trying to implement addSet inside workoutlistitemcopy
