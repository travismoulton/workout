//3: Need functionality to have user-created exercises. Not yet sure how this is going to impact the search functionality
//4: Need to add modal with confirmation for deleting workouts and routines
//5: Add workout from search isn't generating a default set


// FINISHED BUT SAVE FOR LATER
FOR CHANING WORKOUT STRUCTURE:
//1: WorkoutListItem must change. Need to change the input structure. Start w/ Set 1 and has a weight and reps input. Have a button for adding another set
//2: Redux workout store will need to change. Each exercise object will contain a sets array made up of objects with weight and reps number values
//3: Will most likely want to create a component to represent each set, and host all logic about incrementing and decrementing weight and reps in there.


SUB_STEPS:
//1: In create workout line 267 addExercise is dispatched. I will need to change the object to contain 
  name, id, and a sets array that contains objects with weight and reps values

//2: The props being passed to WorkoutListItem will need to change. Specifically weight, sets, and reps. 
  Will just pass the sets array containing objects with weight and reps data

//3: Need to a button to add additional Sets

//4: I believe the updateExerciseData action will need to be modified.

//5: Left off at trying to implement addSet inside workoutlistitemcopy
