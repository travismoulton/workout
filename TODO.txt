//2: Need to re-work creating / recording workouts. Different sets should be displayed seperately, with the option to have different weight and rep counts per sets
//3: Need functionality to have user-created exercises. Not yet sure how this is going to impact the search functionality


FOR CHANING WORKOUT STRUCTURE:
//1: WorkoutListItem must change. Need to change the input structure. Start w/ Set 1 and has a weight and reps input. Have a button for adding another set
//2: Redux workout store will need to change. Each exercise object will contain a sets array made up of objects with weight and reps number values
//3: Will most likely want to create a component to represent each set, and host all logic about incrementing and decrementing weight and reps in there.
