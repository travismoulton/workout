//1: Go through and configure the enter button to act as expected on each component -- Maybe
//2: Add a feature to text search for workouts?
  => Would need to grab all exercises on page load from firebase. Then just search against those.
//3: Should show last recorded workout, and workouts last week on the user profile page
//4: Add functionality to have user's picture through firebase
//5: If you are editing a workout, and you use the add from search functionality, it goes back to create-workout
//6: Add Time and Distance options to workout creation
//8: On userprofile, it's possible to active the dropdowns before the component is ready. Need to add a loaded piece of state
//9: If you delete a workout that is contained in a routine, that routineLink on userProfile doesn't update the workout count unless the page is refreshed
//11: After recording a workout, it's not immediatley available for view in the profile
//12: Need an exercise not found component if there is no exercise at the exerciseDetail URL
